     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     This is your submission. Fill each section in as you finish the milestone
     it belongs to — don't leave it all to the end.

     Unit 3 asks for the first five sections. Unit 4 adds the five below them.
     Leave the unit 4 sections alone until then; they're here so you know
     what's coming.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images, no video links.
     A typed block of output gets full credit; a picture of the same output
     gets none.

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 3 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences: what a user asks for, and what they get back. -->



---

## Tool Inventory

<!-- Four lines per tool. This is worth 2 points and it's the single most
     common place students lose them.

     "Returns a list" earns NOTHING. The description has to say what is IN
     the list.

     The empty case isn't optional either — it's the thing your loop branches
     on, and if you don't decide it here you'll discover it as a crash in
     Milestone 5. -->

### `search_listings`

- **What it does:** Filters the 40 listings in `data/listings.json` by price and size, then ranks what's left by how many words from `description` appear in each listing's `title`, `description` and `style_tags`. It does not call the model.
- **Inputs:**
  - `description` (str): keywords such as `"vintage graphic tee"`. Matching ignores case. One point per query word found in the title, description or tags. Words under 3 characters are ignored.
  - `size` (str or None): `None` skips size filtering. Otherwise the listing's `size` is split on `/`, spaces and brackets into tokens, and the listing matches if any token equals the requested size, ignoring case. `"M"` matches `S/M` and `M/L` but not `XL (oversized)`, and `"S"` never matches `US 9`. Shoe sizes are compared as `US <n>` (`"8"` matches `US 8`, not `US 8.5`). Waist sizes are compared as `W<n>` (`"W30"` matches `W30 L30`). `One Size` listings pass every size filter.
  - `max_price` (float or None): inclusive ceiling. `None` skips price filtering.
- **Returns:** a `list[dict]` of listing dicts, highest keyword score first, at most `config.SEARCH_RESULT_LIMIT` (10). Each dict is the listing unchanged, with keys `id` (str), `title` (str), `description` (str), `category` (str), `style_tags` (list[str]), `size` (str), `condition` (str), `price` (float), `colors` (list[str]), `brand` (str **or None**) and `platform` (str). Listings with a score of 0 are dropped. Ties keep file order.
- **When it has nothing:** returns an empty list `[]`. It never returns `None` and never raises. This is what the loop branches on.

### `suggest_outfit`

- **What it does:** Asks the model, through `generate()`, for one or two outfits built around the thrifted item. When the wardrobe has items, the outfits use pieces the user already owns.
- **Inputs:**
  - `new_item` (dict): one listing dict from `search_listings`, with the same keys as above.
  - `wardrobe` (dict): `{"items": [...]}`. Each item has `id` (str), `name` (str), `category` (str: tops / bottoms / outerwear / shoes / accessories), `colors` (list[str]), `style_tags` (list[str]) and `notes` (str or None). `items` may be an empty list.
- **Returns:** a non-empty `str` of plain text with 1–2 outfit suggestions. With a wardrobe, each outfit names specific pieces from it by `name`, so it never invents clothes the user doesn't own.
- **When it has nothing:** if `wardrobe["items"]` is empty or missing, it still returns a non-empty `str`: general styling advice for the item (what kinds of pieces, colors and vibe go with it). It never returns `""` and never raises for an empty wardrobe. If the model can't be reached, `ModelUnavailable` propagates up to the loop.

### `create_fit_card`

- **What it does:** Asks the model, through `generate()`, for a short social-media caption about the find that sounds like a real post, not a product description.
- **Inputs:**
  - `outfit` (str): the string `suggest_outfit` returned.
  - `new_item` (dict): the same listing dict that was passed to `suggest_outfit`.
- **Returns:** a `str` caption of 2–4 sentences. It mentions the item's `title`, `price` (as `$NN`) and `platform` exactly once each, and describes the vibe of the outfit specifically. Captions vary between runs (`TEMPERATURE` = 0.9).
- **When it has nothing:** if `outfit` is empty or only whitespace, it skips the model call and returns the fixed string `"Couldn't write a fit card: no outfit suggestion was provided for <title>."`. It never returns `""` and never raises for an empty outfit.

## Planning Loop

<!-- Your branch rule, stated as a rule — the condition AND both paths — plus
     the file and function that holds it.

     Like this:
       "If search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in the session
        and stop. Otherwise take the first result and go to suggest_outfit."
        — agent.py::run_agent

     The grader checks your code against what you claim here, so the file and
     function have to be real. -->

**Branch rule:** If `search_listings` returns an empty list, put a message in `session["error"]` that names what the user could change (broader words, a different size, a higher price ceiling), and return the session without calling `suggest_outfit` or `create_fit_card`. Otherwise, put the first result in `session["selected_item"]` and go on to `suggest_outfit`, then `create_fit_card`.

**Where it lives:** `agent.py::run_agent`

**How the query is parsed:** with regex, not a model call. A `$<number>` (optionally after "under", "below" or "up to") becomes `max_price`. `size <X>` becomes `size`. Whatever text is left becomes `description`. Regex costs nothing and gives the same answer every time. The tradeoff is that it misses phrasing it wasn't written for: "under thirty dollars" sets no price ceiling.

**What moves through the session:** `query` → `parsed` (`description`, `size`, `max_price`) → `search_results` → **branch** → `selected_item` → `outfit_suggestion` → `fit_card`. `error` is set only if the run stops early. When it is, every field after the stopping point stays `None`.

---

## Sample Run

<!-- Two things go here.

     1. One FULL query and its output, pasted as text.
     2. Your three per-tool terminal tests — the command and what it printed. -->

**One full query**

```
$ python app.py ask '...'

```

**The three tools, tested one at a time**

```
$ python -c "from tools import search_listings; print(search_listings('graphic tee', max_price=30))"

```

```
$ python -c "from tools import suggest_outfit; ..."

```

```
$ python -c "from tools import create_fit_card; ..."

```

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. What you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not enough.

     "I gave Claude my search_listings spec. It returned None on no match
     instead of an empty list, so I changed it" is the level we want. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 4 — THE TEST ═══════════════════════

     Don't fill these in during unit 3.

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria, five tries each, in this exact format.

     Five, because your criteria are written out of five. Mark each try PASS
     or FAIL, count the passes, and read that count against your target — a
     row targeting 4 of 5 with three PASS cells is MISSED (3/5).

     `python run_eval.py --label before` runs everything and writes the table
     into results/. Paste it here and fill in the verdicts. -->

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Real output from one try**, pasted as text, naming the file and function
that produced it:

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED per criterion against LAST UNIT's target, plus a sentence on
     how you decided.

     Then, for every miss: which of the four places it happened — a tool, the
     loop's branch, the session, or the model's output — AND the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The fit card was bad."
     A diagnosis:      "The fit card criterion missed on 2 of 5 items. Both had
                        an empty brand field. My prompt puts the brand in the
                        first sentence, so the card opened with a blank and read
                        like a fragment. The tool worked; the prompt assumed a
                        field that isn't always there."

     Look for a pattern. Three misses on the same tool is one problem, not
     three. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

**Diagnoses**

## Loop Trace

<!-- One full run, printed step by step, with the MCP call visible in it.

     `python app.py ask '...' --trace` once you've added the trace.step()
     calls in Milestone 2.

     Worth pasting BOTH the happy path and the empty-search path. The empty
     one should be visibly shorter, because it stops. If your two traces are
     the same length, your branch isn't working — and this is the fastest way
     anyone will ever find that out. -->

**Happy path**

```

```

**Empty search**

```

```

**On the MCP move:** <!-- what changed in your code, and whether anything
behaved differently afterwards. If the rewire didn't work, say exactly where it
broke — the error text and the last thing that worked. That earns the point in
full. -->



---

## The Improvement

<!-- What you changed, why your diagnosis pointed at it, and the after-run in
     the same table format. One change, measured properly.

     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

**What I changed:**

**Which failure it was meant to fix:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it made things worse, say that. Honestly reported, that earns full
     credit and is more interesting than one that worked. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped where
     you did. "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is
     left is not. -->
